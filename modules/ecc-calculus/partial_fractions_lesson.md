## 1. Introduction

### 1.1. Learning Objectives

In this lesson, you will:

- Understand the purpose and method of partial fraction decomposition.
- Learn to factor polynomial denominators effectively.
- Solve partial fraction decompositions algebraically.
- Interact with examples using symbolic computation (SymPy).
- Reflect on your understanding through guided questions.

### 1.2. What is Partial Fraction Decomposition?

Partial fraction decomposition (PFD) breaks down complex rational expressions into simpler fractions, which makes integration and other mathematical operations easier. It is especially useful in calculus and algebraic simplifications.

### 1.3. Importance in Mathematics

Partial fraction decomposition is fundamental in calculus, particularly for integrating rational functions, solving differential equations, and analyzing Laplace transforms.

## 2. Fundamentals of Partial Fractions

### 2.1. Steps for Partial Fraction Decomposition

To decompose a rational function:

1. Factor the denominator into irreducible factors.
2. Write the rational function as a sum of fractions with unknown numerators.
3. Multiply both sides by the common denominator.
4. Equate coefficients of corresponding powers of x to solve for unknowns.

### 2.2. Example with Detailed Steps

Given:

$$
f(x) = \frac{1}{x^2 + 2x - 3}
$$

First, factor the denominator:

$$
x^2 + 2x - 3 = (x + 3)(x - 1)
$$

Thus, we have:

$$
\frac{1}{x^2 + 2x - 3} = \frac{A}{x + 3} + \frac{B}{x - 1}
$$

### 2.3. Solving Algebraically

Multiplying through by the denominator:

$$
1 = A(x - 1) + B(x + 3)
$$

Expanding and grouping like terms:

$$
1 = Ax - A + Bx + 3B = (A + B)x + (-A + 3B)
$$

Equating coefficients:

$$
0 = A + B \quad \text{and} \quad 1 = -A + 3B
$$

We solve using SymPy:

```{code-cell} ipython3
from sympy import Symbol, Eq, solve_undetermined_coeffs

A = Symbol('A')
B = Symbol('B')
x = Symbol('x')

solve_undetermined_coeffs(Eq(1, A * (x - 1) + B * (x + 3)), [A, B], x)
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
equation1 = Eq(1, A * (x - 1) + B * (x + 3))
equation1
```
