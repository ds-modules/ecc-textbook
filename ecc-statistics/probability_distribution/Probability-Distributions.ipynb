    "You work at a busy hospital emergency room where ambulances arrive at an average rate of 5 per hour. Two things you notice are that each ambulance's arrival does not have an effect on when the next one will arive (independent) and that their intervals are not evenly spaced or predictable (random). A Poisson distribution can model the probability of the hospital receiving exactly 7 ambulances in an hour. It can also predict the likelihood of having 2 or fewer arrivals in a given timeframe in order to help staff prepare and come up with effective strategies for delagating shifts.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Define the random variable.**  \n",

    "\n",
    "2. **Check that a Poisson model is appropriate.**  \n",
    "   - Arrivals are **independent** (one ambulance arriving does not affect the next).  \n",
    "   - Arrivals happen at a **constant average rate** of 5 per hour ($\\lambda = 5$).  \n",
    "   - We are counting the **number of events in a fixed interval of time** (1 hour).  \n",
    "   These are exactly the conditions under which the Poisson distribution is a good model.\n",

    "3. **Identify the parameter.**  \n",

    "\n",
    "4. **Probability of exactly 7 ambulances in one hour.**  \n",
    "   We want $P(X = 7)$. Using the Poisson pmf:\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "   P(X = 7) = \\frac{5^{7} e^{-5}}{7!}.\n",

    "### Memorylessness Property ###\n",
    "\n",
    "The memorylessness property is a characteristic of certain probability distributions where the probability of an event occurring in the future is independent of the past. In simpler terms, if a process has already been running for some time, the probability that it will continue for a certain amount of additional time remains the same as it was at the start. The exponential distribution (for continuous variables) and the geometric distribution (for discrete variables) are the classic examples of memoryless distributions. This property is useful in modeling situations like the time until failure of a machine or the number of trials until success in a Bernoulli process.\n",
    "\n",
    "The probability of waiting n more trials for success does not depend on how many failures have already occured as each trial has to be independent. \n",
    "\n",
    "And lastly, each call attempt (trial) is for a single customer. If we're tracking multiple different customers calling about the same issue, then each call would be a new and independent event. Geometric distribution would not apply here."

There are several others you can utilize depending on the problem you are trying to solve. The probability mass function lets you obtain the probability that a discrete random variable is exactly equal to some value. Additionally, you interacted with parameters for each probability distribution function to observe how they behave. "
