    "The makeup of the health workforce plays a critical role in shaping health outcomes, especially for historically underserved populations. Despite the growing diversity of the U.S. population, racial and ethnic minorities remain underrepresented in many healthcare professions. For instance, although Black Americans make up over 12% of the working-age population, they account for just [5.4% of physicians](https://newsroom.ucla.edu/releases/proportion-black-physicians-little-change). Hispanic individuals--who represent 18.5% of the population--make up less than 6% of the physician workforce. These gaps reflect systemic barriers to access, education, and advancement in healthcare careers, and they raise concerns about the ability of the system to serve all communities equitably.\n",
    "\n",
    "[Another research](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2772682) also shows that patients often experience better outcomes and greater trust when treated by healthcare providers who share their racial or cultural background. This connection can foster better communication, more accurate diagnoses, and improved patient satisfaction. A diverse health workforce also brings a wider range of perspectives, helping institutions identify and address health disparities more effectively. In this notebook, we’ll explore the relationship between race, occupation, and education in healthcare using real-world data, and reflect on why representation is not only a matter of justice--but also one of quality care. But first, let's hear some insights from two industry professionals below."
